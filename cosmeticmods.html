                                One of the best looking choices for aftermarket headlights are the Vland 
                                sequential headlights. These headlights offer an aggressive and slick "boomerang" DRL,
                                with awesome looking sequential turn signals.

                            <p>A very popular choice for these cars are the Valenti tail lights. These tail lights completely
                                change the look of the rear-end and feature an amazing design, as well as a cool sequential turn signal.

                                If you're looking to get a good track fitment and not break the bank, Megan Racing lowering springs
                                are the way to go. They only cost $175 and are a quality part that will make your car handle and look
                                so much better. These lowering springs will lower your car about 1.75 inches, allowing some great looking stance.

                                If you're looking to go even lower without spending too much, Raceland offers a set of adjustable coilovers that can lower
                                your car up to 3 inches. These coilovers cost $549, and while the quality and performance isn't as good as some more expensive
                                options, they don't do too bad.

                                An 18x8.5 +30 offset wheel paired with a 235/40R18 tire will give your car a perfect flush fitment without running into any rubbing issues.
                                This is one of the best wheel and tire sizes to run if you're wanting a tight fitment with a very slight top tuck.
