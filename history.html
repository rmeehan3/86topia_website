                                </h1>
                                    <p>The modern 86 came about as a joint project between Toyota and Subaru, the original AE86, however, is a different story.
                                        The AE86 is what started it all. It was a rear-wheel drive Toyota Corolla produced from 1983 to 1987. The car was front-engine,
                                        rear drive, 2 door, and powered by a 4 cylinder. The low weight paired with the near-perfect balance made for perfect and snappy handling,
                                        causing this car to become highly popular amongst track drivers and drifters.

                            <p>
                                In 2008 Toyota bought a large stake in FUJI Heavy Industries, which was Subaru's parent company. It had been a long time since Toyota made a sports car, and they 
                                wanted to get back into the game. Toyota decided to design a sports car that was a successor to the AE86, focusing on light-weight handling
                                and a wonderful driving experience. To help with handling, Toyota wanted to use a boxer engine, due to their super low center of gravity. Thankfully, that was Subaru's
                                specialty. In 2009 Toyota revealed this new project being developed in partnership with Subaru, known as the FT86 Concept. Then, in 2013, Toyota would finally release the car 
                                under it's youth-oriented brand, Scion, and name the car the FR-S. Subaru would also release their model, known as the BRZ, and in Japan, Toyota released it as the GT86.
                                The GT86, BRZ, AND FR-S all follow the same front engine, rear drive, sporty formula as its predecessor, matter of fact, FR-S stands for "Front-engine, Rear-drive, Sport".
                                People immediately began raving about how great the car was and it quickly became a legend. Nowadays you can hardly go to a track or drift event without seeing at least one 86.

                        <h1>
                            The Present - The GR86
                        </h1>
                            <p>    
                                The production of the twins continued all the way to 2021, in 2017 however, Toyota ended its Scion brand, and re-released the FR-S as the GT86 in the US.
                                Although the GT86 was very popular amongst enthusiast, some people didn't quite grasp the point of the car, and demanded more horsepower. People began
                                begging for the next generation to be turbo-charged, and rumors began spreading about it being a possibility. However, Toyota stuck to their guns, and when
                                the second generation came out, there was no turbo in sight. People still loved the new car though, due to it's slight horsepower increase from the new 2.4L engine
                                and the removal of the torque-dip. This new generation would be known as the GR86. Due to the performance improvements over the previous generation, and the fact that 
                                many GT86 parts, such as headers and exhaust, still worked on the new car, this car was an instant hit.
