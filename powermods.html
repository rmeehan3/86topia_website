                            Exhaust
                        </h1>
                            <p>
                                A good exhaust will give your car a beautiful sound and also open the car up a little, 
                                improving the driving experience overall. These cars a very popular, (rightfully so) so
                                there are hundreds of different exhaust systems out there. This list contains three different
                                types of exhausts, each at varying price points so you can find something that fits your budget.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cheap</li>
                                <p>
                                    If you're looking to get a decent sound for a cheap price, buy a an exhaust tip (or two if you're into dual exhausts)
                                    and head over to your local muffler shop and get a muffler and resonator delete. On most 4-bangers this setup wouldn't
                                    sound too good, as without the resonator there's simply too much rasp. However, it sounds surprisngly good on these boxer engines.
                                    This setup is pretty loud yet keeps a good tone all throughout, however, try to throw a resoantor back on if you get catless headers.
                                </p>
                                <li>Moderate</li>
                                <p>
                                    If your budget lies somewhere in the middle, you can either get an axleback exhaust, or a cheap catback. The SPEC-D dual-exit catback exhaust is
                                    a very popular exhaust for these cars with a pretty decent tone, and it will run you only $309. If you're looking for a better sound and 
                                    you budget is a little higher, another great option is the HKS single-exit catback. This exhaust not only has a great sound but is also very light-weight,
                                    making it a perfect choice for the track.
                                </p>
                                <li>Expensive</li>
                                <p>
                                    There are many great exhausts for this platform, and some of them can be quite expensive, however the sound they offer in return is great.
                                    One of the most popular exhausts for this platform is the Tomei 80r. This is a full titanium exhaust with an excellent exhaust note and a stunning
                                    large single-exit that suits the car perfectly. This exhaust is very loud yet still keeps a good tone throughout. It will set you back $1,600.
                                </p>
                                </ol>
      
                        <h1>
                            Headers
                        </h1>
                            <p>
                                Headers will not only make your car sound great and give it that rumble everyone loves,
                                but they also add some horsepower, help to remove the torque dip, and are essential for tuning.
                                There's two options for headers, equal length (EL) or unequal length (UEL). Most people go with UEL headers,
                                as they are very efficient for boxer engines and provide that iconic Subaru rumble, while EL headers tend to 
                                sound more like a typical four cylinder. For both types of headers, you also have the option of catless or catted.
                                Most people choose catless headers for more power and a better and louder sound. If you're looking to get some UEL
                                catless headers on a budget, check out the PLM UEL catless headers. They costs $400, which is about as cheap as it
                                gets for headers, yet the quality still holds up pretty well and they provide a pretty good sound. If you do get PLM
                                headers though, make sure to order your own gaskets, as the PLM ones are known to be a little weak and end up with a leak.
                                Grimmspeed sells great exhaust manifold gaskets for $27. <br><br>
                                If you have a higher budget and want a better quality and sound, get the Borla UEL catless headers. These are widely known
                                as the deepest and most rumbly sounding headers available for these cars. There were some quality issues with the first version,
                                however Borla has fixed this with their V2 version. The Borla UEl catless headers will run you about $700. I have these on my FR-S,
                                and I can assure you these headers are guaranteed to leave you satisfied.

                            Tuning
                        </h1>
                            <p>
                                Tuning your car is something every owner should aim to do at some point.
                                Tuning will allow you to reach the full potential of the car without going
                                forced induction. <br><br>
                                The most common route for tuning is with OpenFlash. The OpenFlash tablet comes with three off-the-shelf tunes:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Stage 1</li>
                                    <p>The stage 1 tune is for cars that are stock, and helps to eliminate the torque dip. While the difference isn't
                                        insane, it is noticable and much better.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Stage 2</li>
                                    <p>
                                        The stage 2 tune is for cars that have an aftermarket exhaust and UEL catless headers. This tune makes a much bigger
                                        difference than the stage 1 tune, as the headers allow the car to have more power. With this tune, the torque dip is 
                                        basically completely gone.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Stage 2+ e85</li>
                                    <p>The stage 2+ e85 tune is for cars that have exhaust, headers, and are looking to run e85. This is the best tune out of
                                        the three, as running e85 truly makes this car so much better. There is much more torque throughout the entire revband, 
                                        not to mention the extra horses. If you have e85 in your area, I highly reccomend giving it a try. Running UEL catless headers
                                        with the stage 2+ 85 tune puts your car at 200 - 210whp. That's a +40 horsepower increase on a naturally aspirated car.
                                    </p>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Running any of the above mentioned tunes is very simple and easy and your OpenFlash tablet will walk you through each step as you do it,
                                    with the exception of the Stage 2+ e85 tune. The e85 tune is a bit more complicated to do. To tune your car on e85 with the OpenFlash tablet,
                                    run your gas down until your gas light comes on. Then, head to an e85 pump and fill the tank up with e85. After filling the car. After filling
                                    up your car, plugg in your OpenFlash tablet and click on the "Realtime Data Display". Drive your car around while monitoring your STFT and LTFT values. When both of these
                                    values have started shifting to the other direction, that indicates that e85 has now made its way through your fuel lines and it's now time to flash
                                    the tune onto your ECU. Pull over, turn your car off, and follow the on-screen directions your tablet provides you. Once the tuning process is complete, drive
                                    your car below 3,500 RPMs for the next 10 - 20 mile and do not go WOT, otherwise your car will be in open-loop mode, which the ecu cannot properly learn in, causing the tune
                                    to take longer to settle or even malfunction. After you've drove these 10 - 20 miles, you can check your values again in the realtime data display. Once the values are looking good,
                                    you're free to drive the car like it's meant to be.
                                </p>
