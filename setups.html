                The first thing you're going to need is a good wheel and tire setup.
                While the stock setup is a lot of fun for sliding the rear-end out and drifting,
                it won't cut it at the track. The car is much better and becomes a track monster with
                a proper wheel and tire setup. If you want a nice mix between street and track while
                still staying on the aggresive side, buy a light-weight set of 18x8.5 +30 offset wheels
                and some grippy 235/40R18 tires. This combination give you enough width to grip up and when
                combined with camber bolts up front, will also give you a perfectly flush setup that looks amazing. 
                If you want some amazing tires of the track, look into the Kenda Kaiser KR20As.

            <li>Camber</li>
            <p>A little bit of camber can go a long way on the track. SPC sells a pair of camber bolts for around $30
                and they are super simple to install and will give your car 1 - 3 degrees of negative camber, allowing you just the 
                perfect amount of camber to destroy the track and still be preactical
