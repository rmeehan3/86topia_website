                        <h3>Oil Viscosity</h3>
                            <p>
                                The oil Toyota and Subaru recommend for this car is 0w20, and it works great. If you're looking to track your card hard though,
                                you should consider using a higher viscosity oil such as 5w30. Even if you're just going to be driving your car day to day, it's 
                                not a bad idea to run 5w30 in the hot summer and 0w20 in the cold winter, although you don't have to.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Oil Changes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pump Gas</li>
                        <p>
                            Assuming your car is N/A and running 91/93 pump gas, you should be changing your oil every 6,000 miles. Thanks to the boxer engine
                            layout, oil changes are extremely quick and easy on these cars, and if you have an FR-S, you most likely even have a drain lever
                            rather than a bolt, making it even easier.
                        </p>
                        <li>
                                E85
                        </li>
                        <p>If your car is tuned on E85, you should be changing your oil every 3,000 miles. E85 is great and it
                            is safe, however you still have to take care of the car to keep it that way.
                        </p>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Oil Filter</h3>
                        <p>Any oil filter at a parts store that will fit that car will work just fine. However, many recommend the OEM
                            Subaru oil filter.
                        </p>
