            <h3>Weird Noises</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ticking Noise</li>
            <p>
                No, your car does not have rod knock. Boxer engines are known to make a lot of odd noises
                and many new owners freak out and worry there is something wrong with their engine and that it's
                going to blow up. No need to worry though. If the sound you're hearing is a very faint ticking, you're fine.
                If it's louder and sounds more like someone smacking a metal bar against your engine, then you may need to worry.
            </p>
            <li>Crickets</li>
            <p>
                Another common noise the FA20D makes are the "crickets". This noise is not an issue, it is simply just the sound the
                high pressure fuel pump makes. You may never hear this noise once or you may hear it every time you start your car. Either way,
                there is nothing to worry about. You'll know this noise when you hear it because it sounds exactly like the name implies. The cricket
                noise usually occurs when the car is cold and has been sitting for a few days.
            </p>
            <li>Harsh Ticking</li>
            <p>
                If you have an automatic transmission and you're hearing a ticking noise the follows the RPMs, then you most likely have a bad vacuum pump.
                This is not an urgent issue, but in the long run can cause harm. Thankfully, you can purchase a brand new OEM vacuum pump for $239 and it is
                very easy to change out. Once you replace your bad vacuum pump, this annoying ticking noise will completely disappear.
